# Microscope-PDU
My trinocular microscope has served me well for a few years but it has one annoying thing, the fact that it uses 3 different power adapters: one to supply power to the camera, one for the monitor and another one for the LED lights. This obviously takes up 3 different sockets on my extension lead and creates a mess of wires.

My solution to the problem is this Power Distribution Unit where I have a single 12V input and 3 outputs to feed the required voltages. The board was designed to be configurable, so you have the option of installing a standard footprint dc-dc converter if you need different voltages.
